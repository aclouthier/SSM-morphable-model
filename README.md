# SSM-morphable-model

This repository contains the data and functions required for the demo associated with the Mobilize Center webinar [Integrating Bone and Joint Geometry into Musculoskeletal Models](https://mobilize.stanford.edu/webinar-integrating-bone-and-joint-geometry-into-musculoskeletal-models/) created by Allison Clouthier, Anthony Gatti, Erin Lee, and Lauren Welte.
